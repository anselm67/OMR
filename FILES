kernnorm.py
    Normalizes a kern file into a .tokens file suitable for training 
    the network. This all infos that are necessary to display a score, 
    and keeeps only the infos required for playback of the score.
    This lead to a massive reduction in the number of tokens (from 20k down
    to 3k) and much less single occurences of tokens too.
    Run it with:
    # python -i kernnorn.py
